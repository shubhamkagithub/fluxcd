# This is an Ansible inventory file in INI format. You can define a list of
# hosts and groups to be managed by this particular inventory.

# Hosts listed under [debops_all_hosts] will have common DebOps plays
# ran against them. It will include services such as iptables, DNS, Postfix,
# sshd configuration and more.
#
# View the list here:
# https://github.com/debops/debops/blob/master/ansible/playbooks/common.yml
#
# You should check Getting Started guide for useful suggestions:
# https://docs.debops.org/en/master/introduction/getting-started.html

# Your host was not detected as compatible with DebOps playbooks, so you will
# not be able to leverage the above features on your current operating system.
# You can however use a virtual machine as the Ansible Controller.
